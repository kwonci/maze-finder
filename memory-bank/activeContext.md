# Maze Pathfinding Visualizer - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial implementation of the maze pathfinding visualizer
- Building the core grid representation and interaction
- Implementing the BFS pathfinding algorithm with animation
- Creating an intuitive user interface

## Recent Changes
- Set up project structure
- Created memory bank documentation
- Defined core requirements and technical approach

## Next Steps
1. Create HTML structure with grid and controls
2. Implement CSS styling for the maze and UI elements
3. Develop JavaScript functionality:
   - Grid generation
   - Cell interaction for wall creation
   - Start/end point placement
   - BFS algorithm implementation
   - Animation of the search process

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using a grid-based representation for the maze
- Implementing BFS as the primary pathfinding algorithm
- Using CSS classes to represent cell states
- Simple UI controls to ensure ease of use
- Timeout-based animation for step-by-step visualization

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Clean separation between data structure and visualization
- Consistent color coding for different cell types
- Responsive grid sizing based on viewport
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Sequential animation to show the search process

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Grid-based layouts provide efficient representation for maze problems
- Visual animation helps understand algorithmic behavior
- User interaction needs clear feedback mechanisms
- State management is critical for complex visualizations
