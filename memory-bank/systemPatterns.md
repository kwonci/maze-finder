# Maze Pathfinding Visualizer - System Patterns

## System Architecture

### Component Organization
```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
| User Interface   |     | Maze Generator   |     | Pathfinding      |
| - Grid Display   |<--->| - Create Grid    |<--->| - Algorithm      |
| - Controls       |     | - Place Walls    |     | - Animation      |
| - Event Handlers |     | - Reset Maze     |     | - Path Tracking  |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **DOM-based Rendering**
   - Use HTML/CSS grid for maze representation
   - Each cell in the grid is an individual div element
   - State changes reflected through CSS class changes

2. **State Management**
   - Central state object contains complete maze information
   - Grid state includes: walls, start/end points, visited cells, path
   - UI reflects current state through render functions

3. **Event-Driven Interactions**
   - Mouse events capture user interaction with the grid
   - Mode system determines action based on current tool selection
   - Direct manipulation pattern for wall placement and point selection

## Design Patterns in Use

1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
   - Model: Grid data structure and algorithm logic
   - View: DOM rendering and CSS styling
   - Controller: Event handlers and state updates

2. **Observer Pattern**
   - State changes trigger view updates
   - Animation uses timed updates to state

3. **Command Pattern**
   - User actions encapsulated as operations
   - Enables potential for undo/redo functionality

## Component Relationships

1. **Grid ↔ Algorithm**
   - Grid provides structure and constraints
   - Algorithm traverses grid based on rules
   - Path visualization rendered back to grid

2. **User Input ↔ Grid State**
   - Click/drag actions modify grid state
   - Tool selection determines effect of user input
   - Immediate visual feedback after state changes

## Critical Implementation Paths

1. **Grid Generation**
   ```
   Create Grid → Render DOM Elements → Apply Initial Styling
   ```

2. **Pathfinding Process**
   ```
   Get Start/End Points → Initialize Algorithm → Step Through Process → 
   Update Visited Cells → Find Path → Highlight Final Path
   ```

3. **Animation Sequence**
   ```
   Queue Cells to Visit → Set Timeout for Each Step → 
   Update Cells Sequentially → Render Final Path When Complete
   ```
