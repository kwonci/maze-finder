# Maze Pathfinding Visualizer - Progress

## Project Status: Initial Development

### What Works
- Project structure established
- Memory bank documentation created

### What's Left to Build
- HTML structure for the maze grid and controls
- CSS styling for visual representation
- JavaScript functionality:
  - Grid generation
  - Wall placement
  - Start/end point selection
  - BFS algorithm implementation
  - Search process animation

### Current Status
- Project initialization phase
- Documentation and planning completed
- Ready to begin implementation

### Known Issues
- None at this stage (pre-implementation)

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decided on a grid-based maze representation
- Selected BFS as the initial pathfinding algorithm for its simplicity and guarantee of shortest path
- Chosen to use CSS classes for visual state representation
- Determined that timeout-based animation would provide the best visualization experience
