# Maze Path Visualization Project Brief

## Overview
Create an interactive web application that allows users to generate mazes and visualize the pathfinding process between user-selected start and end points.

## Core Requirements

1. **Maze Generation**
   - Display a grid-based maze
   - Allow users to create walls or obstacles in the maze

2. **Point Selection**
   - Allow users to define start and end points within the maze
   - Provide clear visual distinction for start and end points

3. **Pathfinding Visualization**
   - Implement at least one pathfinding algorithm
   - Animate the search process showing cells being explored
   - Highlight the final path when found
   - Provide visual feedback when no path exists

## Technical Constraints
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries)
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
- Optimize for modern browsers

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully generate and modify mazes
- Start and end points can be placed anywhere on the grid
- The pathfinding process is clearly visualized
- The animation speed is appropriate for visual comprehension
