# Maze Pathfinding Visualizer - Technical Context

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5** - Structure of the web application
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations
  - Grid layout for maze representation
  - Transitions for smooth visual feedback
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core functionality
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - Algorithm implementation
  - Animation control

## Development Setup
- Vanilla web development stack (no build tools required)
- Modern browser with ES6 support
- Browser developer tools for debugging

## Technical Constraints
- No external libraries or frameworks (pure vanilla implementation)
- Cross-browser compatibility for modern browsers
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Dependencies
- None (self-contained web application)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Grid Representation
- 2D array containing cell information
- Each cell contains properties for:
  - Wall status
  - Visited status
  - Part of final path
  - Special status (start/end point)

### Pathfinding Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
  - Uses queue data structure
  - Explores cells in order of distance from start

### Animation Approach
- Timeout-based animation
- Sequential updating of cell states
- CSS transitions for smooth visual feedback

### Event Handling
- Mouse events (click, drag) for maze interaction
- Button events for controls
- State-based rendering updates

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized DOM operations
- Throttled event handlers for smooth experience
- Efficient algorithm implementation
